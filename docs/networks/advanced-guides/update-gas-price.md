# Update Gas Price

Within the network configuration files, validators running **Geth Execution Clients** can adjust the minimum gas price for transactions they accept to propose blocks to the network. The minimum gas price is an **individual client setting**. Validators can choose the value they desire for block approval depending on the current network occupation.

:::info Balancing Gas Fees

If most of the network accepts transactions with a small gas price, overall fees will remain lower. However, if the gas price is too high, the validator will propose empty blocks without transaction fees. As the network throughput rises, these values should be adjusted.

:::

:::tip Default Gas Price

The [LUKSO Network Configuration](https://github.com/lukso-network/network-configs) was recently updated to a base gas price of **1 Gwei**. This value is the default setting for nodes running the [latest supported Geth client](../mainnet/running-a-node.md). You can find further information within the related [Validator Substack Announcement](https://luksovalidators.substack.com/p/action-required-for-geth-operators).

:::

:::caution Recommended Gas Price

Due to many nodes still running older clients and the network occupation remaining low, reducing the minimal gas price to a value between **0.1** and **1 Gwei** is _recommended_ to prevent validators from not receiving transaction rewards. Based on the [Network Explorer](https://explorer.execution.mainnet.lukso.network/), the gas price currently levels off between 0.4 and 2.5 Gwei.

## Adjusting the Gas Price

:::info

If you are running Geth and experience block reward issues, please adjust your Geth configuration file. The following examples set the gas price to **0.1 Gwei**. You can raise the value to **1 Gwei** by adding one zero.

1. Move into the node working directory:

   ```sh
   cd <node-working-directory>
   ```

2. Stop your validator:

   ```sh
   lukso stop
   ```

3. Open the Geth configuration file:

   ```sh
   vim configs/<network>/geth/geth.toml
   ```

4. Adjust the gas price value:

   ```text
   GasPrice = 100000000 # 0.1 Gwei
   ```

5. Restart your validator:

   ```sh
   lukso start validator --transaction-fee-recipient "0x1234..."
   ```

1. Stop your validator
2. Open the _LUKSO Stakers_ menu
3. Move into the _Lukso Geth Package_
4. Navigate to the _Configs_ window
5. Add the gas price flag in the `EXTRA_OPTS` field:

2. Move into the docker folder:

   ```sh
   cd <docker-directory>
   ```

3. Open the Docker configuration file:

   ```sh

1. Stop your client services
2. Manually adjust the gas price by either:

   - adjusting the geth configuration file within your [network configuration](https://github.com/lukso-network/network-configs) files:

     ```text
        --miner.gasprice 100000000 # 0.1 Gwei
     ```

   - adding the gas price flag within the startup script:

     ```sh
        --miner.gasprice 100000000
     ```

3. Restart your client services
