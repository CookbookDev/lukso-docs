# Connect a Universal Profile

To interact with a [Universal Profile](../../standards/universal-profile/introduction.md), several methods are available, each catering to different developer requirements and scenarios. Before a connection can be established, users must create their Universal Profile by:

1. [Installing the Universal Profile Browser Extension](/install-up-browser-extension)
2. [Deploying their Universal Profile](https://my.universalprofile.cloud)

Below, we detail the most common approaches and explain why a developer might prefer one over the others.

## Using `window.lukso`

The `window.lukso` method is tailored for direct integration with the UP Browser Extension. This approach allows developers to engage directly with the UP Browser Extension without the need to consider compatibility with other extensions.

:::info Wallet Compatibility

Alternatively to calling the `window.lukso` object, the equivalent `window.ethereum` object can be called within [supported browsers](/install-up-browser-extension), just like other Ethereum wallets.

:::

:::note Manual Deployment

You can also create new [Universal Profiles](../../standards/universal-profile/introduction.md) by ‚öíÔ∏è [deploying them programmatically](../../learn/expert-guides/universal-profile/create-profile.md). However, please keep in mind that you would also have to deploy your own [Transaction Relay Service](../../standards/relayer-api.md) to allow gasless onboarding. Customly deployed profiles will not receive free monthly transaction quota through the LUKSO Transaction Relay Service.

:::

:::success Request Handling

The [Universal Profile Extension](/install-up-browser-extension) automatically manages incoming requests and returns the address of the connected [Universal Profile](../../standards/universal-profile/introduction.md). To get the conrolling EOAs of the [smart contract account](../../standards/universal-profile/lsp0-erc725account.md), you can manually [fetch it's controllers](../expert-guides/key-manager/get-controller-permissions.md).

## Implementing EIP-6963

EIP-6963 is a standard that facilitates a more versatile connection to various wallet extensions. This method is beneficial for developers who require the ability to maintain low-level control over how different extensions are targeted and managed within their dApp.

:::info Example Implementation

If you want to implement EIP-6963 or want to see UP Browser Extension in action along with other extensions, you can visit the [example dApp repository](https://github.com/lukso-network/example-eip-6963-test-dapp).

## Handle multiple extensions

If you expect your users to have multiple browser wallets or extensions, we recommend installing [Web3 Onboard](https://onboard.blocknative.com/) by following our [Web3 Onboard Configuration](./multi-provider.md). The library will allow users to manage multiple browser providers in parallel.

Alternatively, you can use a simple fallback to allow regular wallet connections, if the [Universal Profile Browser Extension](/install-up-browser-extension) is not installed:

<Tabs groupId="provider-lib">
  <TabItem value="ethers" label="ethers">

```js
const providerObject = window.lukso || window.ethereum;
const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(providerObject);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="web3" label="web3">

```js
const providerObject = window.lukso || window.ethereum;
const provider = new Web3(providerObject);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
