## Why should I use Universal Profile Extension over other wallets?

The Universal Profile Extension offers several advantages over traditional wallet services like MetaMask or Rainbow. Regular wallets only manage the cryptographic key-pair, the blockchain account. The account is only secured by a static private seed phrase that can't **be changed or exposed**. If the phrase is leaked or lost, all your digital assets and reputation associated with the account **would be lost with it**.

In addition, regular accounts lack some of the the functionality of UPs such as the ability to attach additional information to your profile, react on transfers, social recovery and transaction relay services.

Universal Profiles help bring **convenience** and **user-friendliness** into the blockchain space. They are **robust and flexible** smart contract-based accounts that support features like social recovery, relay transactions, rights management, upgradeable security, and attachable data right out of the box. Since they consist of programmable and modular smart contracts, they even allow upgrading these accounts with enhanced functionalities.

In essence, using UniversalProfile provides a **safer environment for managing your digital assets** and offers an array of features that make your day-to-day interactions with blockchains easier.

## Where can I download the Universal Profile Extension?

You can download the Universal Profile Extension from the [Extension Guide](/install-up-browser-extension) section of our technical documentation. There is an official release in the Chrome Store and other platforms coming during the mainnet launch process.
