# Feature Requests

## Will there be video guides about LSPs?

Yes, there are already several videos created for the BuildUP #2 hackathon that you can find on the [LUKSO Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNzyUdu4v7bkwBuDV0gSJrrniPsx5bxK_). Additional videos will be released over time.

## Will there be re-occurring developer events?

Yes, developer meetings and events are planned to present our monthly tech progress and move into a more transparent development process. You can now find and discuss weekly tech updates within the official [LUKSO Discord](https://discord.gg/lukso) server.

## Will there be another LUKSO Hackathon?

Yes, weâ€™re planning and preparing future hackathon projects. For official announcements, please follow our [LUKSO Twitter](https://twitter.com/lukso_io) account. You can already have a look into the developer channels on our [LUKSO Discord](https://discord.gg/lukso) to find teammates or project ideas, and get inspired by [previous hackathon project winners](https://medium.com/lukso/buildup-2-hackathon-winners-0f784793bc43).

## Is there going to be a grants program?

Yes, LUKSO is preparing to launch the grant program after the mainnet migration process is fully finalized. As you can see in the [LYX distribution](https://medium.com/lukso/the-lyxe-migration-process-374053e5ddf5), there are reserves and the foundation's treasury to support grants and drive the development of the network.

## Will LUKSO be listed on additional exchanges?

At the moment, LUKSO is available on [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/de), [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/), and [Gate.io](https://www.gate.io/). As the network continues to expand, additionl exchanges may consider joining. It is important to note that this decision is entirely at the discretion of the exchanges.

## Is it planned to have a video guide about setting up a node?

Setting up a node exceeds the network configurations and LUKSO CLI. Complete node setups depend on many influences, such as the operating system, security measures, server location, network configurations and hardware. Due to the various configurations, we cannot issue a standardized guide. However, you can check the [Community Guides](https://docs.luksoverse.io/) by Luksoverse or join the [ETHStaker](https://discord.com/invite/ucsTcA2wTq) Community Discord to get comprehensive knowledge about running a node for EVM networks.

## Will there be a Mobile Application for Universal Profiles?

Yes, LUKSO is actively developing a mobile version of the browser extension that let you interact with your Universal Profiles from your mobile phone. There is no strict release date planned, but we aligned the development of the Mobile and Browser Extension in order to be able to quickly implement features on both sides.
