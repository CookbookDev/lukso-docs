## Whats the best way to use LUKSO?

It's suggested to use the [Universal Profile Extension](/install-up-browser-extension) while interacting with apps and services on LUKSO. The extension offers you a much more user-friendly and feature-rich experience than you would get using regular wallets. However, _any Ethereum-based wallet with custom network support_ can be used to interact with LUKSO.

## Can the Universal Profile Extension be considered a wallet?

The Universal Profile Extension should not be classified as a wallet. While connected Universal Profiles can store assets, the extension serves as a comprehensive center for your blockchain interactions and reflects your on-chain persona with much more capabilities than just holding assets. Each Universal Profile within an extension holds a separate private key that can be exported into any regular Ethereum wallet.
